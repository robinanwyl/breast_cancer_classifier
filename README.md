BENG 203/CSE 283 SP25 Final Project
Group 3: Robin Anwyl, Krithika Iyer, Maahi Shah

The goal of this project is to train a breast cancer classifier to classify cancer vs. non-cancer samples from Zhou et al (2019). We trained and compared performance of several classifiers (support vector machine, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron), leveraging biology-inspired approaches for feature selection (regulons and commercial breast cancer gene panels) and taking steps to minimize overfitting.

This repo contains two Jupyter notebooks (from Google Colab). `BENG203_CSE283_DiffExpr_FeatureSets.ipynb` contains code for differential expression analysis on the dataset and curation of feature sets. `BENG203_CSE283_ClassifierTraining.ipynb` contains code to train the SVM, RF, and MLP classifiers.
